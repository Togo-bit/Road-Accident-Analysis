# Road Accident Risk Analysis – End-to-End Data Analyst Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using **MySQL, Python (Pandas), Excel, and Power BI**.
The dataset contains road and environmental conditions affecting accident occurrences.
The main goal is to identify key factors that influence accident risk and provide meaningful insights through analysis and visualization.

This project simulates a real-world data analyst workflow where raw data is stored, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to support decision-making.

## Objectives

* Store and manage dataset using MySQL
* Perform data cleaning and analysis using Python (Pandas)
* Conduct analysis using Excel pivot tables and charts
* Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI
* Extract insights and provide recommendations

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **MySQL** – Database creation and SQL analysis
* **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)** – Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
* **Microsoft Excel** – Pivot tables and charts
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visualization
* **GitHub** – Project documentation and version control

## Project Workflow

**Dataset → MySQL → Pandas → Excel → Power BI → Insights**

1. Imported dataset into MySQL for structured storage
2. Performed SQL queries to analyze accident patterns
3. Cleaned and processed data using Pandas
4. Created pivot tables and charts in Excel
5. Built interactive dashboard in Power BI
6. Generated insights and recommendations

---

## SQL Analysis (MySQL)

* Total records count
* Average accident risk by road type
* Weather impact on accidents
* Accident distribution by time of day
* Speed limit vs accident risk
* Most dangerous road and weather combinations

---

## Python (Pandas) Analysis

* Data loading and inspection
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering (risk levels, accident per lane)
* Groupby analysis for trends
* Correlation analysis
* Exported cleaned dataset for visualization

---

## Excel Analysis

* Pivot tables for accident trends
* Weather vs accident analysis
* Road type vs risk analysis
* Charts for visualization
* Conditional formatting for high-risk areas

---

## Power BI Dashboard Features

The dashboard provides interactive visual insights:

* Total accidents and average accident risk (KPIs)
* Accident risk by road type
* Weather impact on accidents
* Time-of-day accident analysis
* Speed limit vs risk visualization
* Filters for weather, road type, and lighting
